    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The food options and responsibilities to consider,canteens must be organised and more efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus with photos of the meals they have prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each students or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keepstrack of their previous meal choices and any dietary meal requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and all students alike. Here again, diversity is key.</p>

    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12"> 1.Accuracy. Humans are prone to Error, even if we provide them with computational devices. Automated attendance management systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data. <br> 2. Economics. Have you ever thought that attendance management systems control costs? It saves money by putting an end to inaccurate time reporting,buddy punching,tardiness,time abuse and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by the Assuim Group found that large organisations save up to Â£1600 per employee after implementing automated management systems<br>3.Productivity/Efficiency.Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time-consumimg,laborious and expensive affair. It takes time to process sheets, time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create payroll manually.Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system The time and effort save combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased productivity and improves profits.
